## ED.data

The dataset used in study  is obtained from **UCI machine learning Repository**,  contains 303 instances and 14 attributes, which is also the most commonly used by researchers.  The output field, which is defined as angiographic disease status, has a value range of 1 to 4. To simplify the prediction, the new target will appear as a binary value, value 0 for cases without risk of heart disease, and other value (value 1,2,3,4) means the presence of cardiovascular disease.



After preprocessing the data, dealing with missing values, removing obvious logical errors in the data, and combining variables to reduce unnecessary computational effort, the final data hold 14 independent characteristics from 297 subjects, such as age, chest pain type, blood pressure, blood glucose level, ECG at rest, heart rate, and four types of chest pain. 

It is worth mentioning that the target variable in the source dataset was derived from the number of vessels with lesions in the ten main angiographic vessels as numerical variables. The new target was defined according to the predictive significance: 1 when the patient had stenosis in any of the vessels and 0 when the condition did not exist. 



Also, the effect of age on heart disease was found to be nonlinear in the exploratory study of our data, and to avoid this nonlinear effect, the new age variable was transformed from a numerical variable to a categorical variable. To avoid the effect of different units and magnitudes on the prediction results, the numerical data will be normalized. Categorical variables will be treated as dummy variables to cope with the effects of different factors.
