## ED. Introduction[Incomplete]

According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for approximately 655,000 deaths per year, or 25% of all deaths. The term "heart disease" represents a condition that is the sum of several pathologies, the most common of which is CAD, in which myocardial ischemia, hypoxia or necrosis is caused by narrowing or blockage of blood vessels. However, identifying heart disease is difficult due to diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulses and many other factors. Because of this limitation, scientists have turned to modern methods, such as data mining and machine learning, to predict disease. At this point, it is particularly important to compare the performance of various techniques and algorithms and determine the best method.

 Data mining is a method for extracting connections between data from large databases, and it has been widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. The artificial intelligence system that Dawes TJW built with his team was able to predict the survival rate of patients over the next five years by recording the results of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and blood tests and combining them with the patients' eight-year health records, while professional clinicians were only able to diagnose these patients with 60% accuracy. This offers the possibility of using predictive methods to assist physicians in their decision making.

In this study, the impact of different factors on cardiovascular stenosis was derived by examining typical data from cardiac patients in a data analysis approach and comparing the performance of different models in prediction. The results of the study proved that the support vector machine approach was the best performing of the chosen models.







## ED. Methods

### ED.M.Data Source

The dataset used in study  is obtained from **UCI machine learning Repository**[],  contains 303 instances and 14 attributes, which is also the most commonly used by researchers.  The output field, which is defined as angiographic disease status, has a value range of 1 to 4. To simplify the prediction, the new target will appear as a binary value, value 0 for cases without risk of heart disease, and other value (value 1,2,3,4) means the presence of cardiovascular disease.

### ED.P. Data  preprocessing

After preprocessing the data, dealing with missing values, removing obvious logical errors in the data, and combining variables to reduce unnecessary computational effort, the final data hold 14 independent characteristics from 297 subjects, such as age, chest pain type, blood pressure, blood glucose level, ECG at rest, heart rate, and four types of chest pain. 

### ED.P. EDA

Also, the effect of age on heart disease was found to be nonlinear in the exploratory study of our data, and to avoid this nonlinear effect, the new age variable was transformed from a numerical variable to a categorical variable. To avoid the effect of different units and magnitudes on the prediction results, the numerical data will be normalized. Categorical variables will be treated as dummy variables to cope with the effects of different factors.
