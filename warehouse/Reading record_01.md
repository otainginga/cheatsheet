Comparative Study of Data Mining Classification Methods in Cardiovascular Disease Prediction



## 1.Abstract

1. 医疗科技有海量数据,但不幸的是大部分都没有被发掘， Models developed from these techniques  will be useful for medical practitioners to take effective decision。
2. In this research paper，分类方法，诸如RIPPER classifier, Decision Tree, Artificial neural networks  (ANNs), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)被用来研究【】
3. **Performance of these techniques is  compared through** sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, error rate, True  Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.In our studies 10-fold cross  validation method was used to measure the unbiased estimate of  these prediction models.
4. Results: error rates / accuracy. 
5. Our analysis shows that [] is the best



## 1.Introduction

1.  The heart is the organ that ... If the pumping action ... Life itself is completely dependent on the efficient operation of the heart.
2. there are certain things that **increase a person’s chances** of getting  cardiovascular disease.
3. **Cardiovascular disease (CVD**) refers to  any condition that affects the heart...  [CVD symptoms]
4.  **A number of factors** have been shown to  increase the risk of developing CVD. Some of these are..., 
5. Physicians generally make a diagnosis by evaluating...Note easy,... Therefore, a physician  must be experienced
6. Data mining has been heavily used in the medical field, to help, cases including...
7. Different to compare since it's data-dependent,... **a specific data set**.. 



## 1.Background

several studies







Under this section we will discuss following data mining  classification models to predict cardiovascular disease:

## 1.Method Block

 RIPPER

Decision Tree

Artificial Neural Networks

 Support Vector Machine

## 1.Data

To compare these data mining classification techniques Cleveland  cardiovascular disease dataset from UCI repository was used.  The dataset has 14 attributes and 303 records. Table 1 below lists  these attributes:

## 1.Results

1. **Model were developed using data  mining classification tool <>**,. Initially dataset ...**Algorithm for attribute selection** was  applied on dataset to preprocess the dataset...307-296, On these 296 records data mining classification  techniques were applied.
2.  **confusion matrix** was obtained... confusion matrix is , table shows...explanation
3. **Table 3 shows** sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for different  classification techniques. **Table 4 shows** sensitivity, specificity,  accuracy and error rate for different classification techniques in  graphical format.
4. **Our results shows** that out of RIPPER, Decision Tree, MLP  and SVM models SVM outperforms others in all parameters  Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy and Error Rates. Also, on  ROC space point of SVM Model is closer to prefect point (0,  1) than other models which show SVM to be best predictor of  cardiovascular disease.
